## Current install

`D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Crimson Desert` — **version 1.09**

Top-level layout:

```

- **Engine**: proprietary Pearl Abyss engine, DirectX 12.
- **Total size on disk**: ~126 GB.
- **Version stamp**: `meta/0.paver` is 10 bytes, binary-encoded. Layout
  is fully decoded (see `crimson-rs` `src/binary/paver.rs`, exposed via
  `crimson_paver_read_from_*`): three little-endian u16s `(major, minor,
  patch)` followed by a little-endian u32 `build`. The **minor** is the
  schema-compatibility key. Live 1.09.00 install:
  `01 00 09 00 00 00 24 48 f3 bb` → major 1, minor 9, patch 0,
  build `0xbbf34824`. (1.08.00 was `01 00 08 00 00 00 3e b0 39 dc`,
  build `0xdc39b03e`.) The editor reads this at startup and warns when
  the install's minor isn't one the parser can load
  (`GameDataVersion.CompatibleMinors`, currently `{8, 9}` — 1.08 and
  1.09 share a byte-identical iteminfo schema; `ParserTargetMinor = 9`
  is the latest of that set and the version the dialog displays).

## Historical versions

Used for **cross-version diffing** when the game patches and a parser breaks.

| Path                              | Version  | Storage |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| `F:\Crimson Desert\1.06.01\`      | 1.06.01  | SSD     |
| `X:\Crimson Desert\1.05.01\`      | 1.05.01  | HDD     |
| `X:\Crimson Desert\1.04.01\`      | 1.04.01  | HDD     |
| `X:\Crimson Desert\1.03.01\`      | 1.03.01  | HDD     |

Each subfolder contains the same layout as the current install (pack groups + bin64 + CDMods + meta + mods).

**Migration note**: SSD on F: is finite. Older versions may move to X: as new patches arrive. Code that scans for historical installs should accept multiple roots, not hardcode F: or X:.

## Save files

Per-user, not per-version:

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pearl Abyss\CD\save\<UserID>\
├── slot0/
│   ├── save.save     # main state, ~1.6 MB
│   └── lobby.save    # quick-select metadata, ~506 B
├── slot1/ ... slot105/
└── steam_autocloud.vdf
```

- `<UserID>` is the Pearl Abyss account ID (numeric, e.g. `102190433`).
- Magic header on both files: ASCII `SAVE`.
- Body is ChaCha20 + HMAC + LZ4 — see [save-format.md](save-format.md).

## Version detection (planned approach)

1. Read `meta/0.paver` if present in the chosen install root — authoritative when format is decoded.
2. Fall back to comparing iteminfo item count and pamt directory hashes against known fingerprints (1.03/1.04/1.05/1.06/1.07 each have distinct sets).
3. Save files do not embed a game version directly. We infer compatibility from the TOC layout and field hashes, similar to how `crimson-rs` auto-detects skill format flags.

## Diffing playbook

When a new patch lands and a parser fails:

1. Snapshot the new install (manual: rename the live folder to `<root>\<ver>\`, restage from Steam).
2. Run `tools/diff/diff_iteminfo.py --from <old_root> --to <new_root>` to enumerate added/removed/changed items.
3. Run `tools/diff/diff_pamt.py` to find which pack groups changed (most patches only touch a few).
4. If a binary format's bytes shifted, narrow the field range with `crimson-rs`'s `BinaryReadTracked` trait, then patch the parser. Add a fixture + regression test.

The 1.05 → 1.06 jump turned out to be **zero schema changes** (only +17 items), so the parser stayed the same. The 1.06 → 1.07, 1.07 → 1.08, and 1.08 → 1.09 jumps similarly stayed data-only — the editor loads them all through one schema path. 1.08 → 1.09 in particular was content-only with **no schema drift** (`crimson-rs` commit `0619789`): iteminfo byte-identical to 1.08, all 30 gamedata tables parse, save read/decode/mutate/write-reseal roundtrip clean; per-table key deltas vs 1.08 were character +6, skill +5, knowledge +5, factionspawn +1, gimmick −8, the other 25 tables unchanged. We expect most patches to be data-only; structural changes are the exception (e.g. the slot104 / 1.05-era 23-field `ItemSaveData` vs 1.06+'s 25-field shape — see [status.md](status.md)), and our pipeline is built to make those exceptions detectable.
