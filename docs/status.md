## Current state

- **Editor v1.11.01**, aligned to live game **1.11**. Cut as a **DRAFT**
  GitHub release via the annotated tag `v1.11.01`; CI builds the single-file
  AOT exe and assembles bilingual release notes — a human still clicks
  **Publish** in the GitHub UI after verifying the zip. See
  [release-process.md](release-process.md).
- **Save read/write is version-agnostic.** Each save embeds its own schema, so
  1.05–1.11 saves round-trip byte-perfect in their own format (no version
  conversion). Verified this session at the C# loader level: slot107 (1.11
  native), slot100 (old-format) and slot102 (slot100's 1.11 save-as) all load
  HMAC-ok with `fieldsDecoded == fieldsPresent` (no undecoded drift) and
  survive a write round-trip.
- **Name/icon resolution targets the *installed* game.**
  `GameDataVersion.ParserTargetMinor = 11`, `CompatibleMinors = {11}`. 1.11
  drifted the iteminfo schema (a new per-item `u8`
  `unk_post_apply_drop_stat_type`; 6,333 items) so 1.10-and-earlier installs
  no longer round-trip against this parser and are warned at startup. No
  save-body drift in 1.11.
- **Vendor `crimson-rs` at `cc37011`** (1.11 iteminfo, commit `8fdeb45`). The
  same commit is on `bbfox0703/crimson-rs` **`main`**, which is what CI clones
  — so a release builds against the right parser.
- **Health:** 346 tests pass (0 skipped — live-install + catalog tests parse
  the real 1.11 iteminfo). Debug build clean (0/0). AOT publish clean (single
  `CrimsonAtomtic.exe` ~27.5 MB, `crimson_rs.dll` folded in).

## Feature ledger

The shipped editor surface (generic block/field editor, inventory, sockets,
dye, sealed-abyss, abyss-gates, mount-unlock, knowledge, vendor-buyback,
mercenary-rename, browsers, 32 key-resolver bridges, …) is listed in the
[README](../README.md#editor-features-current). Deep design notes per feature
are in [status-archive.md](status-archive.md).

## Open work / backlog

- **`ParserTargetMinor` / `CompatibleMinors` are still hard-coded C#-side** —
  this was the *fourth* manual bump (8→9→10→11). Promote to a
  `crimson_parser_target_gamedata_minor()` + compatible-set C ABI so Rust is
  the single source of truth and the values stop being duplicated. Friction
  recurs every patch; do it next time this is touched.
- **🐞 World Map parchment composite layer-alignment bug** (from the
  2026-05-17 part-14 work) — the `blur_height` and `road_sdf` layers disagree
  on world coverage, so roads land in the wrong places relative to the
  coastline. Iteration was paused; the likely fix is to validate per-layer
  world ranges or fall back to the 785-tile terrain composite. Still open.
- **Feature-parity backlog vs the reference editor**
  (NattKh's `CRIMSON-DESERT-SAVE-EDITOR-AND-GAME-MODS`) — features we only do
  via the generic field tree (🔸) or not at all (❌): ItemBuffs (iteminfo
  stats/buffs/enchant/transmog), Stores prices/stock, DropSets loot tables,
  SpawnEdit, Skills params (`skill.pabgb`), FieldEdit
  (`fieldinfo`/`vehicleinfo`), inventory storage expansion, dedicated quest /
  equipment-enchant editing, item-pack share/import/export, full reveal-map.
  Most need a new crimson-rs parser first. Full table in the archive.
- **Name resolution gaps** (deferred until prioritised): `MissionKey` /
  `QuestKey` / `KnowledgeKey` (large) / `SkillKey` / field-NPC / learned-skill
  names aren't resolvable from PALOC today — see the gotchas + archive for why
  each is intentionally left blank rather than mislabelled.

## Gotchas — don't relearn these

Condensed; the exhaustive list (PALOC keying internals, per-TypeName
name-resolution coverage, nested-edit path mechanics, fill-stack regimes,
window-restore quirks, etc.) is in
[status-archive.md → "Important context / gotchas"](status-archive.md).

- **Foundation-first.** When parsing produces wrong data, fix the parser or
  schema — never add a workaround in a consumer. (CLAUDE.md rule 12.)
- **Old saves are the same format** (`version=2 / flags=0x0080`, HMAC ok,
  0 undecoded bytes). Block-count drift across slots is gameplay-driven, not
  format-driven.
- **Scalar-only mutation + length-changing ops.** The C ABI mutates
  fixed-size scalars in place; list clone/insert/remove and inline-bytes
  resize are supported via the dedicated ops (incl. the `marker_run_plus_zeros`
  list variant). Anything that changes block length re-encodes the block.
- **String getters use the two-call pattern** (null buffer → required size →
  allocate → fill). Same shape for class names and JSON blobs.
- **`get_block_json` is hand-rolled JSON** (no serde in the cdylib); C# parses
  with a source-generated `JsonSerializerContext` to stay AOT-safe. Field
  values are pre-formatted in Rust — don't reformat in C#.
- **PALOC names are keyed by `(typeByte, upper32-of-u64)`**, scanned once per
  language into a dictionary. iteminfo `string_key` is the internal id (a
  fallback for the ~71 dev items without a `0x70` entry), NOT a PALOC key.
  Empty name cells can be real data (no localized name), not a bug.
- **InventoryKey labels are hard-coded** (`LocalizationProvider.InventoryContainerLabels`)
  — no PALOC namespace. Re-run `Probe_InventoryKeyContainers` if a patch
  shifts the layout.
- **Saves preserve the original file's last-write timestamp** (Steam Cloud +
  the in-game picker sort by mtime). Save As re-anchors the working doc to the
  new path.
- **AOT publish is fragile about the linker.** `<NoWarn>IL2104;IL3053</NoWarn>`
  in the Ui csproj is load-bearing (Avalonia DataGrid 12 roll-up warnings).
  `scripts/package_aot.ps1` only opts into `IlcUseEnvironmentalTools` when the
  `link.exe` on PATH is the **MSVC** linker — a bare `Get-Command link.exe`
  matches Git-for-Windows' GNU coreutils `link` on the CI runner, which makes
  ILC choke on `/DEF: @link.rsp` (this exact trap failed the first v1.11.01
  build). On a clean CI runner, let ILC auto-discover MSVC via vcvars.
- **crimson-rs is read-only here** and CI **clones it fresh from GitHub
  `main`** (the local `vendor/` is gitignored, not used by CI). Land any
  crimson-rs fix on `bbfox0703/crimson-rs` `main` *before* tagging a release.
  `main` is branch-protected (clippy `-D warnings` + `cargo test`); always go
  via PR; never push to upstream `potter420/crimson-rs`.
- **Run tests with `dotnet run --project src/CrimsonAtomtic.Tests`** — this SDK
  rejects the legacy `dotnet test` VSTest path for MTP.
- **Avalonia 12 quirks**: DataGrid pinned at 12.0.0 (core is ahead);
  `Avalonia.Diagnostics` 12.x not released; MVVM uses field-based
  `[ObservableProperty]` (partial-property syntax didn't generate on
  CommunityToolkit 8.4 / .NET 10).

## How to verify state on a fresh checkout

```powershell
# 0. Fetch vendor deps
.\vendor\update_vendors.ps1

# 1. Rust side
Push-Location D:\Github\crimson-rs
cargo test --lib
cargo clippy --all-targets --lib -- -D warnings
cargo test --lib --features c_abi
cargo clippy --all-targets --lib --features c_abi -- -D warnings
Pop-Location

# 2. Python toolchain + crimson_rs as Python module
.\scripts\setup_python_env.ps1
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\tools\extract\extract_save.py --out .\out\save-extract\
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\tools\inspect\inspect_save_body.py

# 3. C# end-to-end
.\scripts\build_rust.ps1          # builds vendor/crimson-rs --features c_abi
.\scripts\build_ui.ps1 -Test      # builds C# + runs xUnit tests (incl. live-save smoke)
.\scripts\package_aot.ps1 -SkipRustBuild   # AOT publish to dist/win-x64/
```

Each step should be green. If anything fails, fix it before touching new code
— drift is harder to chase later.
