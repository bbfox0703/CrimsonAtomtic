## Current state

- **Editor v1.14.01**, aligned to live game **1.14** (`VerMinor` 13 → 14,
  `VerPatch` reset to 1 per the lock-step `VerMinor == ParserTargetMinor`
  convention — `VerMinor` is a **manual** build-identity bump, while
  `ParserTargetMinor` is **ABI-sourced**). Verified locally and **tagged
  v1.14.01** (CI draft release; human Publish pending); it supersedes v1.13.01
  (published 2026-07-04). The release flow (annotated `v*` tag → CI single-file
  AOT exe + bilingual notes → human clicks **Publish**) is unchanged; see
  [release-process.md](release-process.md).
- **1.14 is a content-only patch over 1.13** — item field values changed but
  there was **no schema/layout drift in any subsystem** (iteminfo, save body,
  skill, all 30 gamedata bridges). So unlike the 1.10→1.13 run of four
  consecutive iteminfo drifts, aligning the editor needed **no parser-logic
  change**: the vendored crimson-rs bumped only `PARSER_TARGET_GAMEDATA_MINOR`
  13→14, and the ABI-sourced C# constants followed automatically.
- **Save read/write is version-agnostic.** Each save embeds its own schema, so
  1.05–1.14 saves round-trip in their own format (no version conversion). 1.14
  brought **no save-body drift** (format still v2 / flags `0x0080`). Verified
  this session: the live C# loader suite round-trips clean, and the live-1.14
  `slot107` parses `hmac_ok` with `undecoded_bytes=0` and re-seals
  decode-stable (all 381 C# tests ran with 0 skipped; iteminfo catalog parses
  the real 1.14 data, still 6,508 items).
- **Name/icon resolution targets the *installed* game.**
  `GameDataVersion.ParserTargetMinor` and `CompatibleMinors` are read from the
  crimson-rs C ABI (`crimson_parser_target_gamedata_minor()` → 14;
  `crimson_parser_compatible_gamedata_minors()` → {14}) — not hand-coded. The
  allow-list is kept target-only by convention, so 1.13-and-earlier installs
  are warned at startup even though 1.14's content-only nature means the 1.13
  layout is in fact byte-readable. Full per-version breakdown in
  [game-versions.md](game-versions.md).
- **crimson-rs 1.14 is on `main`.** The content-only 1.14 pin bump is merged to
  `bbfox0703/crimson-rs` `main` (PR #84) and tagged **`v1.0.14.x`** (vendored
  at `7cfe072`). CI clones `main`, so a release cut ships the 1.14 parser.
  Reminder for the next patch: land the crimson-rs change on `main` *before*
  tagging a CrimsonAtomtic release.
- **Health:** full suite green this session (381 C# tests, 0 skipped; after the
  version-pin refresh, 0 failures — live-install + catalog tests parse the real
  1.14 iteminfo, 6,508 items). Release build clean (0/0). Also bumped the
  `runtime.win-x64.Microsoft.DotNet.ILCompiler` central pin 10.0.9 → 10.0.10 to
  track SDK 10.0.302's runtime (a stale pin was tripping NU1109 on restore).

## Feature ledger

The shipped editor surface (generic block/field editor, inventory, sockets,
dye, sealed-abyss, abyss-gates, mount-unlock, knowledge, vendor-buyback,
mercenary-rename, browsers, 32 key-resolver bridges, …) is listed in the
[README](../README.md#editor-features-current). Deep design notes per feature
are in [status-archive.md](status-archive.md).

## Open work / backlog

- **🐞 World Map parchment composite layer-alignment bug** (from the
  2026-05-17 part-14 work) — the `blur_height` and `road_sdf` layers disagree
  on world coverage, so roads land in the wrong places relative to the
  coastline. Iteration was paused; the likely fix is to validate per-layer
  world ranges or fall back to the 785-tile terrain composite. Still open.
- **Feature-parity backlog vs the reference editor**
  (NattKh's `CRIMSON-DESERT-SAVE-EDITOR-AND-GAME-MODS`) — features we only do
  via the generic field tree (🔸) or not at all (❌): ItemBuffs (iteminfo
  stats/buffs/enchant/transmog), Stores prices/stock, DropSets loot tables,
  SpawnEdit, Skills params (`skill.pabgb`), FieldEdit
  (`fieldinfo`/`vehicleinfo`), inventory storage expansion, dedicated quest /
  equipment-enchant editing, item-pack share/import/export, full reveal-map.
  Most need a new crimson-rs parser first. Full table in the archive.
- **Name resolution gaps** (deferred until prioritised): `MissionKey` /
  `QuestKey` / `KnowledgeKey` (large) / `SkillKey` / field-NPC / learned-skill
  names aren't resolvable from PALOC today — see the gotchas + archive for why
  each is intentionally left blank rather than mislabelled.

## Gotchas — don't relearn these

Condensed; the exhaustive list (PALOC keying internals, per-TypeName
name-resolution coverage, nested-edit path mechanics, fill-stack regimes,
window-restore quirks, etc.) is in
[status-archive.md → "Important context / gotchas"](status-archive.md).

- **Foundation-first.** When parsing produces wrong data, fix the parser or
  schema — never add a workaround in a consumer. (CLAUDE.md rule 12.)
- **Old saves are the same format** (`version=2 / flags=0x0080`, HMAC ok,
  0 undecoded bytes). Block-count drift across slots is gameplay-driven, not
  format-driven.
- **Scalar-only mutation + length-changing ops.** The C ABI mutates
  fixed-size scalars in place; list clone/insert/remove and inline-bytes
  resize are supported via the dedicated ops (incl. the `marker_run_plus_zeros`
  list variant). Anything that changes block length re-encodes the block.
- **String getters use the two-call pattern** (null buffer → required size →
  allocate → fill). Same shape for class names and JSON blobs.
- **`get_block_json` is hand-rolled JSON** (no serde in the cdylib); C# parses
  with a source-generated `JsonSerializerContext` to stay AOT-safe. Field
  values are pre-formatted in Rust — don't reformat in C#.
- **PALOC names are keyed by `(typeByte, upper32-of-u64)`**, scanned once per
  language into a dictionary. iteminfo `string_key` is the internal id (a
  fallback for the ~71 dev items without a `0x70` entry), NOT a PALOC key.
  Empty name cells can be real data (no localized name), not a bug.
- **InventoryKey labels are hard-coded** (`LocalizationProvider.InventoryContainerLabels`)
  — no PALOC namespace. Re-run `Probe_InventoryKeyContainers` if a patch
  shifts the layout.
- **Saves preserve the original file's last-write timestamp** (Steam Cloud +
  the in-game picker sort by mtime). Save As re-anchors the working doc to the
  new path.
- **AOT publish is fragile about the linker.** `<NoWarn>IL2104;IL3053</NoWarn>`
  in the Ui csproj is load-bearing (Avalonia DataGrid 12 roll-up warnings).
  `scripts/package_aot.ps1` only opts into `IlcUseEnvironmentalTools` when the
  `link.exe` on PATH is the **MSVC** linker — a bare `Get-Command link.exe`
  matches Git-for-Windows' GNU coreutils `link` on the CI runner, which makes
  ILC choke on `/DEF: @link.rsp` (this exact trap failed the first v1.11.01
  build). On a clean CI runner, let ILC auto-discover MSVC via vcvars.
- **crimson-rs is read-only here** and CI **clones it fresh from GitHub
  `main`** (the local `vendor/` is gitignored, not used by CI). Land any
  crimson-rs fix on `bbfox0703/crimson-rs` `main` *before* tagging a release.
  `main` is branch-protected (clippy `-D warnings` + `cargo test`); always go
  via PR; never push to upstream `potter420/crimson-rs`.
- **Run tests with `dotnet run --project src/CrimsonAtomtic.Tests`** — this SDK
  rejects the legacy `dotnet test` VSTest path for MTP.
- **Avalonia 12 quirks**: DataGrid pinned at 12.0.0 (core is ahead);
  `Avalonia.Diagnostics` 12.x not released; MVVM uses field-based
  `[ObservableProperty]` (partial-property syntax didn't generate on
  CommunityToolkit 8.4 / .NET 10).

## How to verify state on a fresh checkout

```powershell
# 0. Fetch vendor deps
.\vendor\update_vendors.ps1

# 1. Rust side

cargo test --lib
cargo clippy --all-targets --lib -- -D warnings

Pop-Location

# 2. Python toolchain + crimson_rs as Python module

.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\tools\extract\extract_save.py --out .\out\save-extract\
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\tools\inspect\inspect_save_body.py

# 3. C# end-to-end
.\scripts\build_rust.ps1          # builds vendor/crimson-rs --features c_abi

.\scripts\package_aot.ps1 -SkipRustBuild   # AOT publish to dist/win-x64/
```

Each step should be green. If anything fails, fix it before touching new code
— drift is harder to chase later.

## Session changelog (newest first)

One line per milestone; full detail in [status-archive.md](status-archive.md).

- **2026-07-17 — game 1.14 alignment (v1.14.01)**: first content-only patch
  since the 1.10→1.13 run of four consecutive iteminfo schema drifts — 1.14
  changed item **values** but not the layout, and the save body / skill / all
  30 gamedata bridges parse unchanged (crimson-rs `v1.0.14.x`, vendored at
  `7cfe072`; only `PARSER_TARGET_GAMEDATA_MINOR` bumped 13→14). Because the C#
  `ParserTargetMinor` / `CompatibleMinors` are ABI-sourced (since 1.13), the
  editor alignment was just the manual `VerMinor` 13→14 lock-step bump plus a
  version-pin test refresh (`NativePaverReaderTests`: happy-path now pins the
  1.14 paver `01 00 0e 00 00 00 f8 42 7d 59` / build `0x597d42f8`, the
  previous-minor guard moved to 1.13, and the "future minor" guard to 1.15).
  Live 1.14 `slot107` parses `hmac_ok` / `undecoded_bytes=0`; all 381 C# tests
  ran with 0 skipped and 0 failures after the refresh. Also bumped the
  `runtime.win-x64.Microsoft.DotNet.ILCompiler` central pin 10.0.9 → 10.0.10
  (SDK moved to 10.0.302, whose auto-injected ILCompiler tripped NU1109 on the
  stale pin). Tagged **v1.14.01** (CI draft → human Publish).
- **2026-07-04 — window position memory + drift-free maximize/restore (all
  windows)**: ported UE5CEDumper's window-restore design. New pure, unit-tested
  services `WindowRestoreState` (deferred-commit snapshot state machine),
  `WindowPlacement` (off-screen visibility + centering), `WindowStateStore`
  (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\CrimsonAtomtic\window-state.txt`, AOT-safe key=value). The
  **main window** now (a) restores last-session position/size/maximized on
  restart — validated against the monitors present this session (a rect on a
  now-absent monitor is reset to centered-on-primary), wired via
  `MainWindow.AttachWindowState` in `App.axaml.cs` before the window shows — and
  (b) gained the previously-missing off-screen position guard + **deferred
  (Background) re-apply** + re-seed, so repeated maximize/restore no longer
  drifts or jumps to 0,0 (the old code re-applied synchronously mid-transition —
  the anti-pattern). **20 resizable child dialogs** attach the new
  `ManagedWindowRestore` helper (one line per ctor, no `.axaml` re-rooting) for
  the same drift-free maximize/restore; the 5 fixed-size dialogs are unchanged.
  +33 unit tests; smoke-verified end-to-end (restore-on-restart + save-on-close).
- **2026-07-04 — game 1.13 alignment (v1.13.01)**: fourth consecutive
  iteminfo schema drift (+25 items → 6,508; `SubItem` `type_id` 16→17;
  `prefab_data_list` + `gimmick_visual_prefab_data_list` merged into
  `MergedPrefabVisualData` relocated to item end), plus `partprefabdyeslotinfo`
  +570 rows (968 → 1,538) with a new additive `DyeExtraLayer` 2nd layer — all
  inside the Rust parser; no save-body change (format v2 / flags `0x0080`,
  `slot107` = live 1.13 save, all round-trip). Vendored crimson-rs at
  `7462f0e` / tag `v1.0.13.x`. **Retired the manual `ParserTargetMinor` /
  `CompatibleMinors` bump chain (8→9→10→11→12→13):** wired the C#
  `GameDataVersion` constants to the new crimson-rs C ABI
  (`crimson_parser_target_gamedata_minor()` /
  `crimson_parser_compatible_gamedata_minors()`, commit `a3ab5ee`) so Rust is
  the single source of truth. Bumped editor `VerMinor` 12 → 13 (manual
  build-identity), `VerPatch` reset to 1. Fixed two live-install test drifts:
  `Pyeonjeon_Arrow` `item_type` 0 → 23 (game remap) and the Paz LZ4-icon test
  (the `cd_icon_skill_*` icons are gone in 1.13 → switched to a still-LZ4
  `itemicon_gachaimage_*`). **Released as v1.13.01** (published 2026-07-04) —
  the release bundles this alignment plus the same-day DyeExtraLayer
  2nd-dye-layer UI and the window-position-memory work.
- **2026-06-19 — game 1.12 alignment (v1.12.01)**: third
  consecutive iteminfo schema drift (+150 items → 6,483; four byte-perfect
  layout changes) + `partprefabdyeslotinfo` dye-table drift (−143 rows → 968),
  no save-body change. Synced the gitignored `vendor/crimson-rs` from local
  `crimson-rs` `dev` `0694dfb` (not yet on `main`), rebuilt the native lib,
  bumped `ParserTargetMinor` / `CompatibleMinors` / `VerMinor` to 12, refreshed
  the paver tests. 346 tests green against the real 1.12 install;
  `slot106` / `slot107` verified `hmac_ok` + `undecoded_bytes=0` +
  decode-stable. Later released as v1.12.01 (tag `1.12.01`).
- **2026-06-12 — v1.11.01**: aligned editor to game 1.11 (iteminfo `u8`
  drift, no save-body change); rebuilt native lib; bumped NuGet packages +
  fixed the ILCompiler-pin / CI `link.exe` traps; refined zh-TW translations;
  cut the v1.11.01 release.
- **2026-06-09 — v1.10.01**: version-sync convention
  (`VerMinor == ParserTargetMinor`); broad Tools-menu dialog localization pass
  (en/ja/zh-TW, ~710 keys); 4 UX fixes (localized warnings, Browse-Items
  "go to item", restore-no-double-backup).
- **2026-06-05 — game 1.10**: first iteminfo schema drift since the 1.05/1.06
  `ItemSaveData` change (−`money_icon_path`, +`UnitData.unk_post_icon_path`) +
  the `ContentsMiscSaveData` leading-pad save-body fix.
- **2026-05-31 — feature wave**: Mount-Unlock dialog (sigil grant + dragon
  element/knowledge transplant), Faction-node editor, Knowledge editor,
  discoverable Add-Item flow, bulk-fill caps, Sealed-Abyss preview dialog,
  Add-Item localization, mercenary-name read-back FFI.
- **2026-05-29 — game 1.09**: content-only (no schema drift);
  `CompatibleMinors` became an allow-list.
- **2026-05-22→23 (parts 15–17)**: staticlib pivot for single-file AOT
  publish (`crimson_rs.dll` folded into the exe); type-byte discovery harness;
  1.08 baseline.
- **2026-05-14→18 (parts 1–14)**: initial editor build-out — save
  load/decode/mutate/write, generic block/field tree editor, scalar-path
  editing, name-resolver bridges, inventory / sockets / dye editors,
  multi-language localization + PALOC pipeline, icon pipeline, World Map view.
- **earlier**: crimson-rs reverse-engineering + Python toolchain foundation
  (save format, PABGB family, PAZ containers).
